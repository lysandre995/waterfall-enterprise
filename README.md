# Synopsis

“The future must be like a river that carries us forward, not a waterfall that crashes down upon us.” This is the motto of the CEO of **Waterfall**, a tech company pioneering in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Its flagship product, **“Dante”**, is an algorithm capable of cloning people — simulating their tasks, behavior, and even their voice. Thanks to Dante, Waterfall is preparing to become the first company with a fully digitized and automated management.

However, the company’s reputation is threatened by a journalist investigating the current head of administration — a pregnant woman whom Dante is set to replace.

**Waterfall** is not a play about artificial intelligence or computer science. It is a play about the corporate working world — made of managers, CEOs, investors, and hopeful recent graduates desperately chasing presentations, performance indicators, and overloaded servers. A frantic world that looks only forward, never back, and pushes us to ask: what does progress truly mean?

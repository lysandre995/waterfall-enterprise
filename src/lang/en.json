        "li-h4": "Sustainable innovation",
        "li-p4": "Innovation is a river that flows endlessly, but it must be directed. We don’t create just for the sake of creating: every development has a specific purpose, aimed at improving the everyday lives and real work of our clients.",

        "p6": "Not something crashing down, but a force that pushes us forward with balance, direction, and awareness. Because progress should not overwhelm: it should accompany."
